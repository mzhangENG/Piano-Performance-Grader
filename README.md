# Piano-Performance-Grader
This application serves to grade the user's audio file of a piano performance against an ideal reference. For example, the user could upload an ideal performance of Twinkle Twinkle Little Star along with their own performance to recieve a grade based on note accuracy and tempo. To run this code, it requires the installation of the following libraries: numpy, math, librosa, and tkinter. In my experience, it seems to run best on the actual VS Code application rather than on the Github VS Code.
